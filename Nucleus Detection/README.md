# Nucleus Detection

## Spot Nuclei. Speed Cures.
Imagine speeding up research for almost every disease, from lung cancer and heart disease to rare disorders. Here I am creating an algorithm to automate nucleus detection.
We’ve all seen people suffer from diseases like cancer, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Alzheimer’s, and diabetes. Many have seen their loved ones 
pass away. Think how many lives would be transformed if cures came faster.
By automating nucleus detection, you could help unlock cures faster—from rare disorders to the common cold.

## Why nuclei?
Identifying the cells’ nuclei is the starting point for most analyses because most of the human body’s 30 trillion cells contain a nucleus full of DNA, the genetic code
that programs each cell. Identifying nuclei allows researchers to identify each individual cell in a sample, and by measuring how cells react to various treatments, the
researcher can understand the underlying biological processes at work.

## Finding the Nucleus help to...
* Locate cells in varied conditions to enable faster cures
* Free biologist to focus on solutions
* Improve throughput for research and insight
* reduce time-to-market for new drugs- currently 10 years
* increase number of compounds for experiments
* improve health and increase quility of life
