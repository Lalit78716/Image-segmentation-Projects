# Sandstone Image Segmentation using Random Forest

## Overview
When we have less number of data then this Random Forest technique is more accurate then other algorithm for image segmentation.
So here in this project i choose images and doing feature engineering on that image using verious filter like Gabor, Scharr, Robert, Sobel, Canny, Gaussian, Median, Prewitt, Variance etc and extracting feature from that and insert it in new dataframe for training the model.
after that split the data into training and testing and then i train my Random Forest model with training dataset.

## Model Accuracy on Sandstone dataset
  98.13%
